<ul>
<li>In this project, I've rebuilt the form6 used by nvsp.in for registering new voters.</li>
<li>The page is very straightforward which doesn't have any of the dynamic functionality on the page, neither does the form actually submit.</li>
<li> The motive was to make it look like the real page as much as I reasonably could.</li>
</ul>
